Hello, fellow code wranglers!

Today, we’re diving into the magical world of AI APIs—the kind of tech that can turn your app from “meh” to “whoa!” faster than you can say “machine learning.” And as indie developers, we know budgets can feel like that last slice of pizza at a party: always in danger of disappearing. So, we’re spotlighting some incredible APIs that have free tiers, perfect for stretching those dollars like they’re made of elastic!
