I found that writing what you learn can be very useful as it can be your second brain. This ideology sounds great to me as I am a developer and doing studies. To write and save my writings I have setup a system that uses multiple services for hosting my blogs online and save locally.

# My typewriter

Finally, after so much procrastination I installed Obsidian for writing my notes and for blogs too as it I selected this because it was open source and works fine with markdown. I am using it for a while and It is a great piece of tech. Enough talk as this is my first day writing about what in which I am writing.


# How it is hosted

As I know Obsidian has a paid plan for notes backups which is good as hosting is very cost-full.
I deployed by Writings on GitHub Pages as it is a free thing and It was very easy to do that with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) framework.

# Hugo - Behind 

I used [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) to convert markdown to html as with this it was very easy to do as I just did installed Hugo locally created a project added a pre-build theme and just copy-paste markdown files to `content` folder inside Hugo project that's it. Quickly pushed code to GitHub wrote a simple GitHub Workflow to deploy Hugo Site on GitHub Pages and That's it.

My blog site is online to add more stuff I just need to sync my `writes` folder with Hugo Site `content` folder and push to GitHub which I can do by running a simple script.
