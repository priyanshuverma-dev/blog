My typewriter Finally, after so much procrastination I installed Obsidian for writing my notes and for blogs too as it I selected this because it was open source and works fine with markdown. I am using it for a while and It is a great piece of tech. Enough talk as this is my first day writing about what in which I am writing.

I deployed by Writings on GitHub Pages as it is a free thing and It was very easy to do that with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a> framework.</p><h1 id=hugo---behind>Hugo - Behind</h1><p>I used <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a> to convert markdown to html as with this it was very easy to do as I just did installed Hugo locally created a project added a pre-build theme and just copy-paste markdown files to <code>content</code> folder inside Hugo project that&rsquo;s it. Quickly pushed code to GitHub wrote a simple GitHub Workflow to deploy Hugo Site on GitHub Pages and That&rsquo;s it.</p><p>My blog site is online to add more stuff I just need to sync my <code>writes</code> folder with Hugo Site <code>content</code> folder and push to GitHub which I can do by running a simple script.</p><p><img src=https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b8e419d3-8013-49e4-8e31-746ad6d49644 alt></p><p>Simple Yet awesome and free website generated in less then 2 hrs. With some knowledge about techs around us!</p></div></div><div id=footer><span class=post-meta>&copy; Priyanshu Verma &nbsp;2024
