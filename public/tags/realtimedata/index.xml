      <description>Hello builders, Many of you knows me but in case I am Priyanshu Verma, An Open-source Indie Developer.
In this Article we are going to talk about how you can deploy Fluvio integrated apps like APIs on internet for free. It is very easy to do so, As Today I will guide you how to. So, Without any delay let&rsquo;s see what to do.
As To deploy fluvio we need a project with it&rsquo;s integration. I have one from recent Fluvio Series. This is a basic Nodejs Express API with some endpoints and fluvio integration. I won&rsquo;t explain more about it you can explore this on GitHub. This article is just for deployment.
