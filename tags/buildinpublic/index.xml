Many of you knows me but in case I am Priyanshu Verma, An Open-source Indie Developer.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In this Article we are going to talk about how you can deploy Fluvio integrated apps like APIs on internet for free.
It is very easy to do so, As Today I will guide you how to. So, Without any delay let&amp;rsquo;s see what to do.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As To deploy fluvio we need a project with it&amp;rsquo;s integration. I have one from recent &lt;a href="https://dev.to/priyanshuverma/series/28713">Fluvio Series&lt;/a>.
This is a basic Nodejs Express API with some endpoints and fluvio integration. I won&amp;rsquo;t explain more about it you can explore this on &lt;a href="https://github.com/priyanshuverma-dev/fluvio-deploy-example">GitHub&lt;/a>. This article is just for deployment.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Yes, It's easy to build a Fluvio connector in Rust.</title><link>https://priyanshuverma-dev.github.io/blog/yes-its-easy-to-build-a-fluvio-connector-in-rust./</link><pubDate>Sun, 08 Sep 2024 07:32:57 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://priyanshuverma-dev.github.io/blog/yes-its-easy-to-build-a-fluvio-connector-in-rust./</guid><description>&lt;p>In today’s fast-paced world, real-time data is no longer a luxury—it’s a necessity. Whether you&amp;rsquo;re monitoring live stock prices, analyzing social media trends, or syncing spreadsheets for instant insights, having data at your fingertips can make all the difference. That’s where &lt;strong>&lt;a href="https://www.fluvio.io">Fluvio&lt;/a>&lt;/strong> comes in, a platform designed to streamline your data journey by offering a powerful, yet easy-to-use, infrastructure for building and managing data pipelines.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>But here’s the real magic of Fluvio:&lt;/strong> It gives you the tools to not only move data between systems but also build your very own custom connectors! Imagine you’re working with Google Sheets, and you want your data to flow seamlessly from a Fluvio topic into a spreadsheet in real-time. Manually exporting data sounds tedious, right? What if you could build an outbound connector that does all this for you automatically?&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
